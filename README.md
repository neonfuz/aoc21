AOC 2021 Solutions
==================

These are my solutions to [AOC 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).

Each file is numbered by day. The .txt files are the inputs supplied to me by
AOC. There are 2 challenges each day, so the solutions are numbered like 01a.js
01b.js 02a.js etc.

Running
-------

Run with deno, with the --allow-read flag so it can read the input files.

Example for day 2 solution b:

``` sh
deno run --allow-read 02b.js
```
